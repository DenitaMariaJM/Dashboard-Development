This project involves the development of an interactive Sales Dashboard using Python’s Dash framework, aimed at providing dynamic, real-time insights into a company’s sales performance. Built with powerful libraries such as Pandas, Plotly Express, and Dash, this dashboard allows users to explore sales data visually and intuitively. The core dataset (train.csv) includes transaction records with attributes like region, product name, category, sales amount, and order date. The application begins by preprocessing the data—converting order dates to a datetime format and extracting monthly sales trends. The main purpose of the dashboard is to help business stakeholders easily monitor sales performance across different regions and product lines.
